*** TODO Ask Rafal about gantry updates, who does design check?
There is a preference to support the gantries from below. It is very important that pile drawings be issued asap so that
piling can continue before the launching gantry is in place. Rafal requested that all documentation that is currently
available be compiled for review.

:NOTES:
- WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-0211 shows a 400x400x12 gantry spanning 14673mm
- Cantilever boxes are much bigger ~700x700x16
- For barrier mounted connection, the barrier will have to be structurally connected to a large foundation, see e.g. WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-0601
- WGT-402-410-DRG-YWL-410-060-0585-0 shows veloway connection brackets. Propose something similar for gantries? Support from above was not seen as acceptable.
