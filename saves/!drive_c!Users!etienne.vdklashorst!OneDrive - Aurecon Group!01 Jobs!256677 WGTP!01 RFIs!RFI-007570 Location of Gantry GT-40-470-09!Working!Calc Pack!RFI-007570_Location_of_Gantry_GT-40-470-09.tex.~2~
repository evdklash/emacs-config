\section{Introduction}

This design note concerns the capacity checks and connection design/specification for a new overhead steel gantry onto an exiting elevated freeway barrier. The solution proposed is similar to what was done on the same freeway under a previous construction project. The connection method as shown in Appendix~\ref{app:D} was proposed by the contractor as being suitable for efficient construction taking account of on-site conditions. The existing barrier geometry was extracted from the ``as-built'' information and is presented in Figures~\ref{fig:02} and~\ref{fig:03} and Appendix~\ref{app:B}. The new gantry and barrier location is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:01} as well as Appendix~\ref{app:A}.

\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item High Performance Level barriers are only required where the gantry leg is located within 1m\ of the roadside face of the barrier. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Design loads}
The design load for the gantry in question is listed on WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-038 attached as part of Appendix~\ref{app:A} here. \marginpar{The gantry reaction forces need further checking. The moment $M_{z}$ seems too high.}

\section{Barrier capacity}
From Figure~\ref{fig:03} we see that the existing barrier is reinforced using Y16-230 ligatures with ligatures at closer spacing where barriers are joined. For this analysis a capacity check on standard spacing only is considered as it is argued that the gantry could be moved away from a barrier joint location if required. The barrier capacity is calculated as per the recommendations of \textcite{austroads2013} and the \textcite[\S A13.2]{aashto2017}. The method using a yield line design and the length of impact loading as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:05} of \SI{500}{kN} (outwards) is used. The design calculation is shown as a Python script in Appendix~\ref{app:C}.

The results of the calculation show that the barrier has a nominal impact resistance of approximately \SI{657}{kN} while the wall has a moment capacity of about $M_{c} = \SI{71}{kNm/m}$ (wall bending about a horizontal axis parallel to deck)\marginpar{This value should be compared with the starter bar bending capacity}.
