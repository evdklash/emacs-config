\section{Introduction}

This design note concerns the capacity checks and connection design/specification for a new overhead steel gantry onto an exiting elevated freeway barrier. The solution proposed is similar to what was done on the same freeway under a previous construction project. The connection method as shown in Appendix~\ref{app:D} was proposed by the contractor as being suitable for efficient construction taking account of on-site conditions. The existing barrier geometry was extracted from the ``as-built'' information and is presented in Figures~\ref{fig:02} and~\ref{fig:03} and Appendix~\ref{app:B}. The new gantry and barrier location is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:01} as well as Appendix~\ref{app:A}.

\section{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item High Performance Level barriers are only required where the gantry leg is located within \SI{1}{m} of the roadside face of the barrier. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Design loads}
The design load for the gantry in question is listed on WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-038 attached as part of Appendix~\ref{app:A} here. \marginpar{The gantry reaction forces need further checking. The moment $M_{z}$ seems too high.}. The listed design loads are however shown as a \ac{uls} envelope and not broken down into specific load combinations. This is important as \textcite{as5100.2} defines \ac{uls} load combinations which implies that the ultimate wind load does not need to be taken as occurring at the same time as a vehicle impact load.

\end{figure}
To obtain accurate base reactions gantry GT-40-470-09 was analyzed using Strand7. The basic load cases consisted of structure own weight, signage own weight, wind load along the road direction and wind load across the road. As expected, the maximum reactions at the base of the structure is produced for wind loads onto the signage area together with maximum own weight. However, this set of reactions should not be combined with impact loading onto the barriers.

  \caption{Ultimate gantry reactions for structure and signage own weight only. The vertical reaction at each gantry leg is approximately \SI{58}{kN}. Note that the reactions are not symmetric due to the difference in signage area and location.\label{fig:06}}
\end{figure}
The action effects for the barrier design/capacity check is derived from the following load combinations:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Vehicle impact load onto the barrier plus gantry own weight acting behind the barrier
\item Gantry reactions for gantry connected behind the barrier. Gantry reactions for wind load along the road direction, i.e.\ perpendicular onto the signage.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}

  
\section{Barrier capacity}
From Figure~\ref{fig:03} we see that the existing barrier is reinforced using Y16-230 ligatures with ligatures at closer spacing where barriers are joined. For this analysis a capacity check on standard spacing only is considered as it is argued that the gantry could be moved away from a barrier joint location if required. The barrier capacity is calculated as per the recommendations of \textcite{austroads2013} and the \textcite[\S A13.2]{aashto2017}. The method using a yield line design and the length of impact loading as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:05} of \SI{500}{kN} (outwards) is used. The design calculation is shown as a Python script in Appendix~\ref{app:C}.

The results of the calculation show that the barrier has a nominal impact resistance of approximately \SI{657}{kN} while the wall has a moment capacity of about $M_{c} = \SI{71}{kNm/m}$ (wall bending about a horizontal axis parallel to deck)\marginpar{This value should be compared with the starter bar bending capacity}.
