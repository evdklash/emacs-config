  Jason P will be sending initial comments on scope and future work to Aurecon. I have to comment in broad terms on this so that he can present to the
  client next week Thursday. Final report and documentation to follow on this. \\ We need final resolution about the drainage calculations. Jason will
  provide marked up plans with building dimensions as soon as possible. \\ For the officer's mess building it is clear that the roof drainage will not
  work but we will need to motivate to accept it.

** Notes on site inspection
- All base plate must be grouted as soon as possible after installation of the steelwork to avoid damage to anchor bolts.
- Bolts need to be trimmed down, see AS4100 section 14.3.6.1 stating: "The length of a bolt shall be such that at least one clear thread shows above the nut and at least one thread plus the thread run out is clear beneath the nut after tightening."
- Washers need to fit oversize holes, see AS4100 section 14.3.5.2 b)i) stating that "Oversize hole An oversize hole may be used in any or all plies of bearing-type and friction-type connections, provided hardened or plate washers are installed over the oversize hole under both the bolt head and the nut. The plate washer shall completely cover the hole such that the minimum distance from the edge of the hole to the edge of the plate washer shall be 0.5 times the hole diameter."
- Minimum edge distances need to be observed in all cases. Edge distances are to be in line with anchor specifications in all cases. Where this is not achievable, the matter should be referred back to the structural engineer. In places where concrete has already been cracked due to installation of anchor bolts, the cracked section must be repaired using a suitable fluid epoxy solution such as Sikadur®-52 or similar. Use of expansion anchors is not recommended in any location.
- Repair of honeycombed concrete needs to done using a high build mortar such as Sika® MonoTop® 615HB or similar. The affected portion of concrete must be chiseled away to expose unaffected concrete where there are no surface voids or loose aggregate present

*** TODO Ask Rafal about gantry updates, who does design check?
There is a preference to support the gantries from below. It is very important that pile drawings be issued asap so that
piling can continue before the launching gantry is in place. Rafal requested that all documentation that is currently
available be compiled for review.

:NOTES:
- WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-0211 shows a 400x400x12 gantry spanning 14673mm
- Cantilever boxes are much bigger ~700x700x16
- For barrier mounted connection, the barrier will have to be structurally connected to a large foundation, see e.g. WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-0601
- WGT-402-410-DRG-YWL-410-060-0585-0 shows veloway connection brackets. Propose something similar for gantries? Support from above was not seen as acceptable.
