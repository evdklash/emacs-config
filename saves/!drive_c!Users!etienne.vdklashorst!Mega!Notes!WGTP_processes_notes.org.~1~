* Presentation presented by Paul de Palma on 2020/01/30 Change in process to be
more efficient. This does not deal with pre IFC hold clouds or design changes.
*How do we know if what we are doing constitutes a desihm change?* Process 3 and
4 seem to be the same but the one deals with Bluebeam and the one with CAD? Copy
Debera Tate in the Aconex that contains the checkprints. Some drawings may be in
checkprints folder and not on Aconex yet. So if we start to do a drawing updare.
When a checkprint gets uploaded the revision details must already be filled in.
Any old DCR numbers were part of the previous process. Hold clouds should not be
applied (be on) drawings when the checkprints gets issued. Evidence of
correspondence and drawing updates must go into the RFI folder, this is
especially true for internal review sets. The internal review evidence does not
go to the contractor.

When do we escalate issues? If an RFI has multiple zone influences/effects or of
the RFI is zone wide, then the issue needs to be escalated. Perhaps design
error, ommisstion, specialist review required.

When cahning drawings, make sure to check the checkprints folder fisrt to make
sure that all changes by others are incorporated.

New drawings require a new certificate to be issued. Debera Tate takes care of
issuing certificated for new drawings.

Previous rev cloud need to be left in place when doing Bluebeam drawing markups.
For existing interim revisions, they need to be included into CAD drawings with
the next full revision. On cad drawings the old revision clouds may be
hidden/removed.

For tech notes that go with drawing changes an approval to release form is
required and the tech memoneeds to be entered into the tech memo regsiter.

Andrew McDonald presented on digital requirements. We are contractually required
to maintain CAD and Xref updates as well as models. Models should be updated at
IFC ALWAYS.

CPS management plan and drafting plans will be reviewed and edited and
communicated to all. ** Travis Mcardie - CPS Manager ** David Gloag - Zone 400
