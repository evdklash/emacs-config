- Cantilever boxes are much bigger ~700x700x16
- For barrier mounted connection, the barrier will have to be structurally connected to a large foundation, see e.g. WGT-400-440-DRG-AJV-440-000-0601
- WGT-402-410-DRG-YWL-410-060-0585-0 shows veloway connection brackets. Propose something similar for gantries? Support from above was not seen as acceptable.

There is a preference to support the gantries from below. It is very important that pile drawings be issued asap so that
piling can continue before the launching gantry is in place. Rafal requested that all documentation that is currently
available be compiled for review.

- [X] Resolve bracing on drawing 0602 where new lifting ligs are required next to P3-P06 - Can this be done? Also on drawing 0605 segment 12. Also on drawing 0643, Essentially the cross brace to the tub girder's flanges need to pass over the bracing between the lifting lugs. In this way the diagonal bracing to the flanges need not be changed.
- [X] Confirmation required that a web stiffener can be replaced with a lifting lug
- [X] Confirmation required that a K-brace can be replaced with lifting lug 
- [X] In some case the of LL-KB-WS-KB etc are changed. How important is it not to have two consequtive K-braces? On drawing 0606 Segment 13 for example there are two K-braces side by side. Is this allowed? 
- [X] We can't acommodate the CPBJH proposed lifting lug position on girder B13 South. Drawing 0607 showing the needle beam indicates where lifting lugs can not be used.
- [X] Prepare verification form
